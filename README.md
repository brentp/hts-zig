[![Build](https://github.com/brentp/hts-zig/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brentp/hts-zig/actions/workflows/build.yml)

# (WIP) [zig](https://ziglang.org) wrapper for [htslib](htslib.org) VCF parsing.

I wrote this learning zig so it probably has many non-ziggy usages.
Much of htslib is not supported, but some of the difficult parts are
implemented.



# testing and dev

This will require `zig` and `htslib` installed.
Then the startig point is:
```
zig build test
```
